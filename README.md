# Python-Turtle-Drawings

Hey guys, lemme tell you if you don't know that I am a really realy bad drawing artinst in real life so what I did is that I tried making drawing virtually on my computer screen and look what I actually made some of the great drawings with it. (I know all of you wont fell it as a good drawing but believe me if you will compare these drawings with my actual drawings you will surely feel like these are the best that I could hve made)
Well anyway I basically used python's Turtle library to draw all these. Hopes you will like them.
